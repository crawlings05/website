            <p>This keyboard is a KBDfans KBD67 Lite R2 I obtained from a group buy over three years ago. I wanted it because it was a <em>relatively</em> inexpensive gasket-mounted keyboard. I put Gateron milky black switches(lubed and filmed) in it. The keycap set is GMK Synthwave that I did not get from a group buy. <br> Here is a video of me typing on it.</p>

                <p>This is my Gamecube controller. It is themed to look like EVA Unit 01 from Neon Genesis Evangelion. I chose to include a thumbstick from a Wii nunchuck for looks and because the original thumbstick kept on hurting my thumb while playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate(Peach requires a lot of movement).</p>
                <p>I resin casted these buttons, which involved creating a silicon mold of the original buttons and curing them in a vacuum chamber.</p>

                <p>I wrapped the cable in green paracord. This involved desoldering and resoldering the 6 individual wires on the controller PCB. This was my first experience with soldering.</p>
