                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>I love many forms of exercise. Weight-lifting, biking, walking, bouldering and skating are my favorites. I have always wondered how many calories I burn and my average heart-rate while doing these activites. This project was a part of the Hands-on PCB Engineering DeCal at Berkeley. The idea was to create a module with two seperate PCBs, the top housing power and display components and the bottom housing heart-rate sensing and computational components. This prototype implements MX-style keyswitches and a 3.7V lithium-polymer battery that has charging capabilites.</p>
                
                <h2>Bottom PCB</h2>

                </section>
                <p>The bottom PCB uses the MAX30102 sensor that has the ability to read heart-rate and blood oxygen concentration. I chose to use the ESP32-C3-Mini because of its small form factor and bluetooth capabilites.</p>

                <p>The top PCB houses the EADOGS164 display and battery protection/charging ICs for functionality</p>

                <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p>A few traces weren't connected on the top PCB, but I fixed that with a few jumper wires. The biggest problem with this version lied in how I wired the USB-C connector. I didn't wire VBUS and GND correctly on the bottom PCB, nor did I have a 3.3V to 5V boost to power the connector.</p>

                </section>
                <p>I stayed up all night trying to individually solder the traces on the pcb to the correct pads on the USB-C connector and power with 5V externally via a power supply, but it didn't work and we weren't able to flash any code onto the ESP32.</p>
