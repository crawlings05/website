                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Nuventory sells a piece of software to automotive body shops that allows them to better keep track of their inventory and order more parts when necessary. My role was to create a Python bot to insert images into vendor catalogs so that Nuventory's partner companies have images associated with each part number. The bot collects data from Nuventory's site, searches Google, checks to see if it is the correct part, and inserts the images into the catalog.</p>

                <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
                <p>For about a week, I was stuck on the problem of selecting the next part, which was the key to automating the process. The heights of the parts in the website were not consistent, so I had to increment the amount of times tab was pressed; I still couldn't click on the specific part, however. I realized that when a part is selected, it is highlighted in purple, so I imported opencv2 so that I could take a screenshot and report the mean position of the purple pixels on my screen, which gave accurate depictions of where the mouse should click. <br> Here is a video of it in action:</p>

                        <source src="Color_Recognition.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                </div>
                <p>As you can probably tell, it takes a long time to fill out an entire page and it scales up very quickly when the page number increases(180 pages in total). There were also pretty big inconsistencies with searching and getting correct images, so Nuventory is currently working on a better method for filling out a master catalog that all of its partner companies can use. <br>
