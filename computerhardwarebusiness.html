                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In middle school, I became fascinated by computers after I built my own. Realizing this, I needed a reason to build more computers. I started this business during COVID, when prices of new computer hardware were inflated, so I looked to used hardware on OfferUp, eBay, and EVGA B-Stock midweek madness sales to find the cheapest and most reliable hardware. The image above is the first computer I sold on OfferUp.</p>
                
                
                <p>In that first computer I sold, I swapped out my graphics card(GTX 1060 6GB) and downgraded to this GTX 970 4GB (pictured below). My favorite part about this project was interacting and learning about all kinds of computer hardware from many different generations.</p>

                <p>My favorite computer I built was my own(that I have since passed down to my nephew). Most of the parts, except for the ITX power supply and case, were used. The specs are as follows: <br>
                - Ryzen 5 1600 <br>
                - ASRock B350 Mini-ITX Motherboard <br>
                - 16GB DDR4 3200MH <br>
                - GTX 1080 8GB(I got a crazy deal on this at the time) <br>
                - WD 500GB M.2 SSD <br>
                - Corsair 600W Platinum ITX Power Supply <br>
                The graphics card is liquid cooled(just because) and I personally wrapped every individual power supply line to customize the modular cables.
